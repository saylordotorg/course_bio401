**Unit 6: Nucleic Acids** <span id="6"></span> 
*Our last building block is nucleic acids. There are two types of
nucleotides and five basic nucleobases that are you familiar with. As
simple as this seems, these five carry all of the necessary information
to create complex life, such as ourselves. This unit examines some
shared features of nucleic acids, as well as some general features of
DNA and RNA molecules. Also, we will examine some of the other uses of
nucleobases and nucleotides, as it is not solely for genetics. Lastly,
like all other molecular building blocks, there are pathways to
synthesize and recycle them, and we will learn about this as well.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 12 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:  
  
-   Describe the structure of nucleic acids.
-   Differentiate between ribose and deoxyribose derivatives in terms of
    structure and function.
-   Compare and contrast the difference between eukaryotic and
    prokaryotic DNA genomes.
-   Compare and contrast the structure of DNA and RNA and explain how
    these structural differences contribute to their different cellular
    functions.
