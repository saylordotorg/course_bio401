**Unit 9: Biochemistry of Genes and Chromosomes** <span id="9"></span> 
*We now focus on the core biochemistry topics of DNA and RNA. Much of
this unit deals with two major cellular processes, transcription and
translation. Each topic in this unit can be quite complex, and looking
at visual figures is strongly recommended to aid in your understanding.
If you have taken cell biology or molecular biology, some of these
topics will seem familiar; however, now we are focusing on the reactions
that drive these events rather than learning about the events
themselves.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 6 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 9.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 9.2: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 9.3: 2 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Explain why DNA is used as the genetic material of most organisms.
-   List the steps of DNA replication.
-   Describe how DNA is repaired.
-   Describe the process of RNA transcription.
