**Unit 4: Enzymes** <span id="4"></span> 
*Enzymes are extremely important to life; toxins that destroy enzymes
are almost always lethal. Enzymes, as you already know, speed up
chemical reactions. While this may seem trivial, without the right
chemical reactions life could not happen. Because enzymes function in
the context of chemical reactions, they are classified in a system
according to the type of reaction occurring, and we will cover each of
these six classes. You will also learn about the thermodynamics and
kinetics of enzymes, and how all enzymes share a similar pattern of
energetics regardless of function. Lastly, you will learn what regulates
their activity, as we do not “turn on” every enzyme all the time.*

*Note: Many vitamins are essential to our diet simply because they are
essential for some enzymes to function. Some vitamins are water-soluble,
while others are not. This is why some vegetables are more nutritious
raw than boiled, because immersing them in water washes away
water-soluble vitamins. Please be sure to know which vitamins are
water-soluble and which are fat-soluble.*
