Biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes and compounds, such
as cellular makeup, that bring about life in organisms.  It is a
combination of multiple science fields; you can think of it as general
and cell biology coupled with organic and general chemistry.  Although
living organisms are very complex, from a molecular view, the material
that constitutes “life” can be broken down into remarkably simple
molecules, much like the breakdown of our English language to the
English alphabet.  Although there exists thousands upon thousands of
molecules, they all breakdown into four core components: nucleic acids,
amino acids, lipids, and carbohydrates.  As we can make hundreds of
thousands of words from just 26 letters, we can make thousands of
different biomolecules from those 4 components.  For example, the human
genome, containing the necessary information to create a human being, is
really just one very long strand of 4 different nucleotides. This course
is structured around that approach, so we will begin by discussing each
of these 4 components in detail and how they create the biomolecules
necessary for life.  As there are grammatical rules to every language,
each component has its own set of rules, and we will learn how these
rules play important roles in regulating the ways these molecules
combine and form structures.  We will continue on by looking at how
these formed biomolecules interact and produce many of life’s necessary
processes.  Metabolism, for example, is the set of chemical processes
that produce energy and compounds necessary for other life processes to
occur.  It utilizes carbohydrates as its main energy source, depends on
proteins as its main catalysts for reactions to occur, utilizes
nucleotides to make proteins, and uses lipids for multiple purposes,
including signaling and energy storage.  We will end the course with a
brief look at the most commonly used techniques in biochemistry
research.  These techniques are vital to understanding how new
biochemistry knowledge is obtained.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Recognize and describe the structure of the following basic
    biomolecules: nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates.
-   Diagram how these basic biomolecules are used as building blocks for
    more complex biomolecules.
-   Differentiate between reactions that create biomolecules.
-   Describe how these biomolecules are used in specific cellular
    pathways and processes.
-   Analyze how feedback from one pathway influences other pathways.
-   Explain how energy is utilized by a cell.
-   Indicate how biomolecules and pathways are regulated.
-   Describe how enzymes play a key role in catalysis.
-   Assess which biochemical technique should be used to study a given
    biochemical problem.
