**Unit 2: Amino Acids** <span id="2"></span> 
*We begin our study of biochemistry with a look at amino acids. They are
the primary building blocks of proteins, the diverse set of biomolecules
that make up much of what we are from the keratin in our hair to the
enzymes that aid digestion. There are twenty standard amino acids from
the Central Dogma theory, although there are many more that we encounter
in biochemistry. We begin by looking at stereochemistry and organic
chemistry aspects to gain a good understanding of the chemical nature of
these molecules. Next, we will classify amino acids according to their
organic residues. Most amino acids fall into one of these categories,
and we often refer to amino acids in these groups rather than specific
ones. Finally, we will look at the life cycle of amino acids, from
synthesis and degradation to nitrogen cycling. Most importantly,
nitrogen homeostasis from amino acids is the main reason we produce
urine. Failure to recycle amino acids is lethal!*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Identify amino acids based on their structure.
-   Explain how the various side chains of amino acids influence their
    chemical properties.
-   Describe how amino acids are synthesized and broken down.

     Instructions: This lecture covers information for sections
    2.1.1-2.1.4.  Take notes while you watch.  
        
     Note: Amino acids are found in either L or D configurations,
    although almost all of the amino acids that we encounter are in the
    L configuration.  Be sure to know this fact and the main exceptions
    to this rule.
