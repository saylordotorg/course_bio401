**Unit 7: Lipids** <span id="7"></span> 
*Lipids are the last molecular building blocks that we cover in this
course. They are a very diverse group of molecules, all classified
together by their insolubility with water. There are many types of
lipids, much more than 20 amino acids or 4 nucleotides, and they have
many different functions. For example, some provide energy; you may know
these as fats! Others are the major component of cell membranes, while
still others are powerful signaling molecules, including estrogen and
testosterone. In this unit, we will cover all the major types of lipids,
grouped according to their functions.*
