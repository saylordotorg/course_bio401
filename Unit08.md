**Unit 8: Metabolism** <span id="8"></span> 
*Metabolism can be defined by a number of ways, but in the context of
this course it is defined as the set of chemical reactions and molecules
that occur in which energy is produced for life’s processes. Metabolism
includes two complementary sides, anabolism and catabolism; the former
breaks down large molecules for energy, while the latter builds large
molecules for energy storage. Glycolysis, for example, is the catabolic
breaking down of glucose, while gluconeogenesis is the anabolic building
of glucose from various other biomolecules. You may have heard of
anabolism from steroids, as they are commonly referred to as anabolic
steroids. Bodybuilders use them because they encourage the body to
undergo unnatural anabolism and build molecules beyond a normal amount.
This is a very long and detailed unit, so be sure to spend as much time
as needed to learn all of the concepts, especially when you approach the
section on metabolic pathways.*

     Note: It is very important to keep track of when the products are
    made during glycolysis, as it is a series of many reactions and only
    some of these steps result in a product.  Also, remember that there
    are two molecules of pyruate made per glucose molecule.

certain stage of the TCA cycle, and it is important not to confuse these
feeder pathways.*
