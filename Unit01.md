**Unit 1: Basic Chemistry and Biology Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*In our first unit of biochemistry, we will review some general
chemistry and organic chemistry concepts, as well as a few biology
concepts.  As this course uses both branches of science, it is important
to be familiar with these topics before continuing on.  These topics can
be found in the [BIO101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/),
[CHEM101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem101), and
[CHEM102](http://www.saylor.org/courses/chem102) courses.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 6 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 1.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 1.2: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 1.3: 2 hours

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Discuss and apply the basic concepts of general chemistry, including
    chemical bonding, intermolecular forces, pH, and thermodynamics.
-   Discuss and apply the basic concepts of organic chemistry, including
    organic groups and organic reactions.
-   Discuss and apply the basic concepts of general biology, including
    the central dogma of biology, cellular structure and respiration,
    and DNA replication.
