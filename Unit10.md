**Unit 10: Biochemistry of Signaling** <span id="10"></span> 
*All organisms share some sophisticated and complex pathways to respond
to the internal and external changes of their environment. There is a
signaling pathway for just about everything, from shivering when it is
cold to making stomach acid when you eat to respond to dangerous
bacteria. Although they may be sophisticated and complex, these pathways
all share some fundamental principles. In this unit, we will cover these
fundamental principles and use specific examples to show how these
principles are applied to real signaling pathways. We will first go over
the shared features of all signaling pathways, and then cover each of
the six basic pathways.*
