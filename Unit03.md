**Unit 3: Proteins** <span id="3"></span> 
*Proteins, as you know are the large, complex molecules that are made of
amino acids, so this unit is a natural follow-up to the previous one.
Protein is the equivalent of a strand of DNA to nucleotides, although
protein structure is vastly more complex than a DNA structure. In fact,
protein structure is an essential part of that protein’s function, and
destroying its original structure will destroy its function as well.
This process is known as denaturing, and it most commonly occurs from
exposing proteins to high temperatures. This is why fevers are bad for
people and why the albumen (clear liquid) in an egg turns white when
cooked. Because structure is so important to function, a large part of
this unit concerns the structural properties of proteins. The last part
of this unit will also look at the life cycles of proteins, from
synthesis to degradation.*
