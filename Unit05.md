**Unit 5: Carbohydrates** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit covers carbohydrates (also called sugars), the second of four
molecular building blocks. As you know, carbohydrates are simply
molecules of carbon and water—hence the name of “carbo” and “hydrate.”
The simplest carbohydrates are called monosaccharides, the equivalent of
amino acids. Just as amino acids give rise to many different proteins,
monosaccharides give rise to many different polysaccharides, although
there are not as many polysaccharides as there are proteins. The most
important polysaccharide is glucose, the primary energy molecule of
living organisms. Plants make glucose as the primary product of
photosynthesis, and we use it as our primary fuel. We will learn about
many of the other important sugars, such as sucrose, lactose, and
starch. Sugars are also important signaling molecules in the cell that
help direct cellular traffic. The synthesis and breakdown of
carbohydrates is covered in detail in the Unit 8: Metabolism, so we will
only preview it here.*
