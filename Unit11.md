**Unit 11: Biochemistry Techniques** <span id="11"></span> 
*Our final unit looks at some common laboratory techniques used to study
biochemistry topics. Because much of biochemistry research revolves
around protein and nucleic acids, most of the techniques also revolve
around these two types of biomolecules. Bioinformatics, the newest of
these fields, involves the use of information technology and computing
to study large sets of molecules at a time, instead of working with
individual molecules in the laboratory.*

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 10 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 11.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 11.2: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 11.3: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 11.4: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 11.5: 2 hours

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   List key techniques used in biochemistry.
-   Describe how these techniques define key characteristics of
    biochemical molecules so as to elucidate their structure and/or
    function.
